Github is super helpful. 
Check out notes from 260 to resolve problems

Yelp, Google Reviews, Rotten Tomatoes, IMDB. All great ways to read reviews and read about people's experiences with restaurants, movies, etc. The problem is that the only contributors to these review centered sites are biased. They have had either the best or worst experience with said product or place. Or its all lengthy columns written by critics who just didn't get enough love growing up. You get the picture. The reviews are hardly ever accurate.

Our website will be a totally new way to gauge music, TV shows, local restaurants, political views, and so much more. Utilizing a simple poll system, the site attracts the feedback from the most ordinary of people. Anyone can jump in, vote, and watch live numbers on how much people like and dislike Kanye's new release. See simple stats on local restaurants like food quality, price, convenience. Its the place for getting a sense of what people, who are just like you, think about anything. Your one-stop shop for rating life.

Tanner: things to remember from the simon project is that in order to push to a website, one has to run the deploy funciton from within its own repository. 
Tanner: Files that don't have the specific permissions will not send properly to the webstie. 


Tanner(CSS and HTML ASSIGNMENT): After finising the HTML and CSS for our startup website, I appreciate more the idea of pair-programming. I also learned the importance of being deliberate, yet creative with CSS settings and HTML designs. 


Tanner(Simon JAVASCRIPT): I learned the true important of Javascript. The java made the website so much easier to navigate, and made the game ultimately work. 


margin/border/padding/content
ls - list
ssh - access different computer
sudo - access with authoirty mayor to what you have. 
chmod - change mode. make something executable. 

DOM textContent - sets the child text for an element
For promises, async is needed in order to use await
CNAME creates alias

## Startup Deliverable Notes-  
### HTML/CSS  
Tanner: Files that don't have the specific permissions will not send properly to the webstie.     
HTML and CSS are hard but can be fun and rewarding. It takes a lot of work to get a website looking exactly how you want it so I had to be patient as we worked. I learned a lot more about Bootstrap from this assignment and how exactly it works and interacts with something you are building on your own.

### JavaScript. 
Tanner: I learned how to connect my javascript code that we used to keep track of voting counts to the previous html objects that we created. It a faily intuitive process. Its super facinating seeing all of the pieces slowing coming together.  
Kyle: Writing code for this deliverable really bolstered my understanding and skills in JavaScript. It was cool to figure out how to inject the like and dislike counts by manipulating the DOM.
