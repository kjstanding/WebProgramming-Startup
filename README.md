Yelp, Google Reviews, Rotten Tomatoes, IMDB. All great ways to read reviews and read about people's experiences with restaurants, movies, etc. The problem is that the only contributors to these review centered sites are biased. They have had either the best or worst experience with said product or place. Or its all lengthy columns written by critics who just didn't get enough love growing up. You get the picture. The reviews are hardly ever accurate.

Our website will be a totally new way to gauge music, TV shows, local restaurants, political views, and so much more. Utilizing a simple poll system, the site attracts the feedback from the most ordinary of people. Anyone can jump in, vote, and watch live numbers on how much people like and dislike Kanye's new release. See simple stats on local restaurants like food quality, price, convenience. Its the place for getting a sense of what people, who are just like you, think about anything. Your one-stop shop for rating life.
